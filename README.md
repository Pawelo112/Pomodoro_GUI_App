## 📖 Description 
This is a simple time management app that I made in Python using Tkinter module, during **100 days of code** Python course.

The Pomodoro Technique implemented in this app is a popular time management method that promotes focus and productivity by using a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length separated by short breaks. 
If, like me, you easily fall into the trap of procrastination, this technique can help you a lot and make your work and effort much more effective.  

Here's an overview of how the technique works, along with its advantages:
+ 🕐You work for a focused period - 25 minutes (called a "Pomodoro"). During this time, you concentrate solely on the task at hand without distractions.
+ ⤵️Each time after work section, a checkmark is added beneath the timer to show how many work sessions you have completed.
+ ✅After each Pomodoro, you take a short 5 minute break. This break helps your mind relax and recharge.
+ ☑️ After completing a series of four Pomodoros (4 work sessions), you take a longer 20 minutes break, to refresh yourself more thoroughly.
+ 🔁The cycle continues, with the timer automatically starting the next Pomodoro after each break.

## 🖥️ Usage
+ **Start:** Clicking the "Start" button begins the Pomodoro cycle.  
+ **Reset:** Clicking the "Reset" button stops the timer and resets everything, including checkmarks that track completed Pomodoros.  
+ **Timer Countdown:** The script counts down the work or break periods and updates the timer display.  
When a Pomodoro or break finishes, it automatically transitions to the next stage (work or break) and adds a checkmark for every completed work session.
